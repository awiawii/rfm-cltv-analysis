## Customer Lifetime Value Analysis Using Python
In this project, I developed a comprehensive analysis of Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) using Python. The project involves calculating CLTV, which is crucial for understanding the long-term financial value of each customer. The analysis includes:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
* **CLTV Calculation:** Step-by-step calculation of Average Order Value (AOV), Average Purchase Frequency (APF), Customer Value (CV), and Average Customer Lifespan (ACL).
* **Data Aggregation:** Grouping and aggregating customer data to derive meaningful insights.
* **Exporting Results:** The final CLTV data was exported to Excel for further analysis.
  
This project demonstrates my ability to perform in-depth data analysis and apply financial metrics to assess customer value, which can drive strategic business decisions.
